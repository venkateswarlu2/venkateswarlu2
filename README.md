### web scraping using multithreading

  Multithreading is a technique that allows a program to execute multiple threads concurrently, effectively increasing its performance and efficiency. In the context of web scraping, it can significantly speed up the process of extracting data from multiple websites simultaneously.

**###working of thread:**
Thread Creation: The main program creates multiple threads, each assigned a specific task, such as fetching a webpage, parsing its content, or extracting data.
Concurrent Execution: These threads can run concurrently, sharing the same system resources.
Task Distribution: The main thread distributes tasks to the worker threads, which execute them independently.
Data Aggregation: Once the worker threads finish their tasks, they return the extracted data to the main thread, which can then process or store it.


**Advantages of Multithreading in Web Scraping:**
Improved Performance: By utilizing multiple threads, web scrapers can fetch and process multiple web pages simultaneously, significantly reducing overall execution time.
Efficient Resource Utilization: Multithreading allows better utilization of system resources, especially CPU cores.
Enhanced Responsiveness: User interfaces can remain responsive while background tasks are being executed in separate threads.
Scalability: Multithreading can be scaled to handle larger datasets and more complex scraping tasks.
